# Squink
## Overview

Squink is a dynamic logging library for C applications, representing the first part of a two-part series of sister programs dedicated to logging and log analysis. Squink focuses on capturing and logging application data, while its counterpart, "Stamp", serves as a log viewer designed to analyze and display logged information. These projects are meant as learning exercises.

## Development Goals

The development of Squink is guided by a set of structured goals, organized into Easy, Medium, and Hard categories, each representing a phase in the development roadmap.

- ### [ ] Easy Goals
    - [x] Basic logging functionality

    - [ ] Build system setup (CMake)

- ### [ ] Medium Goals
    - [ ] Configurable log format string
    - [ ] Advanced file logging features (file rotation)
    - [ ] Basic thread safety
    - [ ] Static library compilation
    - [ ] Basic console and file sink configuration
    - [x] Include filename and line number in log messages

- ### [ ] Hard Goals
    - [ ] Advanced thread safety and performance
    - [ ] Dynamic log levels
    - [ ] Method name and thread ID logging
    - [ ] Configurable logging sinks
    - [ ] Comprehensive documentation and examples

## Sister Project: Stamp
Stamp, the second part of this series, is a log viewer program designed to complement Squink. It focuses on analyzing and presenting the data captured by Squink, providing users with valuable insights into their application's behavior and performance. Check it out here: ()
